				<span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span>
				<p>In 1966, a fireball dazzled with shooting colors, smoke and speed as it burned through the atmosphere
					and followed the Hudson river north. Ray and Ryan Whitelaw froze as the deep space intruder showered
					the two with star debris. Over the course of their lives, the brothers would be consumed trying to
					unravel the power and meaning of the rumble-tumble of a rugby ball sized projectile, the mother
					meteor cast off.</p>

				<p>

					After years of search Ray believes he has found the meteor's projectile and begins an astrophysical
					study of its nature and resulting in an Einstein - like equation, written on the pea green plywood
					windows of the pedestrian bridge of a commuter rail station in Yonkers N.Y on the metro-north line.

				</p>

				<p>


					Greystone station becomes a gathering place for partying teens, a lovers lane for cheaters, and
					near-by neighborhood gangs. All, unwittingly drawn by the meteor projectile and Ray's growing
					calculus formula. On their homemade death row, "The High Five" junkies look to Ray and his magnetic
					overpass formula for transmutation and redemption.</p>
